Unit 1 Project - There Was An Old Lady
======================================

Write a program that produces as output the lyrics of the song, “There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly,” by Simms Taback.
Your program must use procedural decomposition to reduce complexity and avoid repetition of code.
Your `main()` method must call a single method, called `printSong()`, which calls methods you define to print the complete song.

When done, the song’s complete lyrics should be printed out (shown below):

> There was an old lady who swallowed a fly.  
> I don't know why she swallowed the fly.  
> I guess she'll die.
>
> There was an old lady who swallowed a spider,  
> that wiggled and wiggled and tickled inside her.  
> She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.  
> I don't know why she swallowed the fly.  
> I guess she'll die.
>
> There was an old lady who swallowed a bird.  
> How absurd to swallow a bird!  
> She swallowed the bird to catch the spider,  
> that wiggled and wiggled and tickled inside her.  
> She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.  
> I don't know why she swallowed the fly.  
> I guess she'll die.
> 
> There was an old lady who swallowed a cat.  
> Imagine that, she swallowed a cat!  
> She swallowed the cat to catch the bird.  
> She swallowed the bird to catch the spider,  
> that wiggled and wiggled and tickled inside her.  
> She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.  
> I don't know why she swallowed the fly.  
> I guess she'll die.
>
> There was an old lady who swallowed a dog.  
> My what a hog, to swallow a dog!  
> She swallowed the dog to catch the cat.  
> She swallowed the cat to catch the bird.  
> She swallowed the bird to catch the spider,  
> that wiggled and wiggled and tickled inside her.  
> She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.  
> I don't know why she swallowed the fly.  
> I guess she'll die.
>
> There was an old lady who swallowed a goat.  
> Just opened her throat and swallowed a goat!  
> She swallowed the goat to catch the dog.  
> She swallowed the dog to catch the cat.  
> She swallowed the cat to catch the bird.  
> She swallowed the bird to catch the spider,  
> that wiggled and wiggled and tickled inside her.  
> She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.  
> I don't know why she swallowed the fly.  
> I guess she'll die.
>
> There was an old lady who swallowed a cow.  
> I don't know how she swallowed a cow!  
> She swallowed the cow to catch the goat.  
> She swallowed the goat to catch the dog.  
> She swallowed the dog to catch the cat.  
> She swallowed the cat to catch the bird.  
> She swallowed the bird to catch the spider,  
> that wiggled and wiggled and tickled inside her.  
> She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.  
> I don't know why she swallowed the fly.  
> I guess she'll die.
> 
> There was an old lady who swallowed a horse.  
> She's dead, of course.

Grading Scheme/Rubric
---------------------
Your grade is calculated using the following rubric:  

| Functional Correctness                                                  |    Points     |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Correctly define the `main()` method.                                 |   2 points    |
| Correctly call the `printSong()` method in `main()`.               |   2 points    |
| Correctly define the `printSong()` method with no parameter.         |   2 points    |
| *Proper use of procedural decomposition.*                               |               |
| - Full procedure decomposition, `printSong()` calls other methods    |   2 points    |
| - Partial procedural decomposition, some work done in `printSong()`  |   1 point     |
| - All work done in `printSong()`                                     |   0 points    |
| Correct output                                                          |   2 points    |
| **Total**                                                               | **10 points** |


| Coding Style (0-2 points, Good/Fair/Poor)     |   Points      |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Readability: Indentation.                     |   2 points    |
| Readability: Meaningful method names.         |   2 points    |
| Readability: Comments/Documentation.          |   2 points    |
| Efficiency: Code duplication.                 |   2 points    |
| Efficiency: Smart algorithm.                  |   2 points    |
| **Total**                                     | **10 points** |
